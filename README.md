Rogue Cyber Security Channel

This is a simple script that webscrapes the URL https://www.loldrivers.io/ looking for any newly posted vulnerable drivers. It then queries your host machine for its current running drivers and parses the response. Then the script looks for any matching drivers and displays them on the console. Finally the script will suggest commands  to either stop or delete the drivers.
